Steps:


1) Simulate data
   - generate sample portfolio using common distributions
   - store in SQL

2) Claims reserve calculations
   - chain ladder calculations

3) Pricing and Risk analysis
   - fit models to projected claims
   - predict future claims and premiums

4) Capital Simulation
   - model reinsurance treaties
   - calculate net losses and VaR

5) UI
   - Make a Python UI that calls underlying C program to do things the way actuaries like them
   - Make underlying C program callable in term if real time speed is necessary



Interesting ideas

  visual term ui?
  real time claims readjustment?
  running monte carlo sims in GPU?
