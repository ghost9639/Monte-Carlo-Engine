// easiest method would be the box_muller approach

// obscure bug where arm64 compiler can mischaracterise floating point paired returns on older
// gcc versions, can make wrapper Double class to fix this

 * This function implements the Box-Muller approach to sampling random normal variables. By visualising

 * the length to transform a uniform variable sample to two normal distribution samples
 *
 * @param mu The mu parameter of the normal distribution
 * @param sigma the standard deviation of the normal distribution
 * @return samples a vector of two doubles, both samples from the normal distribution
